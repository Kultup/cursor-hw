    <p><strong> Algorithms of AI already surpass human abilities in many areas where data processing is involved. They are capable of taking on "creative" functions as well. However, there remain a number of unresolved problems, including ethical ones.</strong></p>
    <h3>Three types of artificial intelligence.</h3>
    <p>Today, scientists define artificial intelligence as algorithms that can learn on their own in order to apply that knowledge to achieve human-defined goals. Machine learning systems (a major subfield of AI) have automated processes in all vital areas including banking, retail, medicine, security, and industry.</p>
    <p>There are three types of artificial intelligence: <strong>narrow AI, general AI (AGI), and super AI (Superintelligence)</strong>.</p>
    <p>The first type, narrow AI, is widely used today (including in voice assistants, social media advertising, facial recognition, dating apps, and so on). These narrow AI systems are the only ones currently available.</p>
    <p>General AI (AGI) is the type of AI that is closest to human intelligence in terms of capabilities and, by the classic Turing definition, possesses self-awareness. According to experts, <u>AGI is expected to be developed by around 2075, and another 30 years after that, it will be time for superintelligence.</u></p>
    <p>Superintelligence could not only become like humans, but also surpass the best human minds in all areas while reprogramming itself, continuing to improve, and likely developing new systems and algorithms independently.</p>
    <h3>What is artificial intelligence capable of now</h3>
    <p>Anyone who uses automatic translators can appreciate the dynamics. Five years ago, Google Translate more or less tolerably coped with individual sets of phrases and sentences, while today the program translates large semantic blocks, neural networks take into account the context, operate with huge arrays of statistical data. Now you can read articles in Hindi, Chinese, Arabic without knowing the language.</p>
    <p>AI has long been used in the financial sector to assess the solvency of a borrower. If you were denied a loan at the first stage, it was artificial intelligence that weeded you out. In the United States, in some states, AI is used in the judicial system to assess the length of prison terms for defendants.</p>
    <p><em>Algorithms help doctors make diagnoses. For example, SberMedia (part of the Sber ecosystem) and the Sberbank Artificial Intelligence Laboratory jointly developed the AI ​​Resp application: a neural network analyzes a patient's voice, breathing, and cough to determine the likelihood of a coronavirus infection. Earlier, the AI ​​Lab and SberMedII introduced the Lung CT online service, which determines the location and degree of lung damage for diagnosing viral pneumonia, including COVID-19, using computed tomography images. Also, when using this service, AI makes it possible to detect oncological diseases at an early stage in the analysis of chest CT and can help doctors in diagnosing.</em></p>
    <p>At the moment, several significant technologies have been developed in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
    <li>GPT-4 from Natural Language Processing (NLP), the most sophisticated yet flexible neural network capable of generating articles on almost any topic that are at first glance difficult to distinguish from human-created.</li>
    <li>A breakthrough in medical science, the AlphaFold 2 neural network is able to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein with high accuracy in just a few hours compared to traditional methods.</li>
    <li>AutoML (automated machine learning) algorithms have made AI accessible to small and medium businesses through integration with cloud systems (eg MLSpace from SberCloud, Microsoft Azure or AutoML from Google). Using the development environment, enterprises can write their own algorithms, for example, to process customer requests or improve demand forecasting.</li>
    <p>AI outperforms humans in IQ and creativity, scoring 40% more on quizzes and 15% more on the SAT than the average college student.</p>
    <h3>The role of AI in the economy</h3>
    <p>PwC predicts an increase in global GDP of $15.7 trillion by 2030 thanks to the development of artificial intelligence. By this time, China will be the world's leading AI power with a 26% increase in GDP, North America will be next with 14.5% GDP growth, followed by 11-12% growth in Europe's largest economies. Developing countries will benefit the least, so there is a risk of widening the digital divide.</p>
    <h3>The impact of the pandemic on the implementation of AI in business</h3>
    <p>The crisis has only accelerated the adoption of AI, and this momentum will continue in the future, polls show: the majority of companies (52%) began to implement AI faster due to the pandemic, 86% of respondents say that AI is becoming the “main technology” in their company.</p>
    <p>Nearly three-quarters of business leaders are positive about the role of AI in the wake of the pandemic and accompanying crisis. The majority of executives (74%) not only expect an increase in the efficiency of business processes, but also the creation of new business models (55%), new products and services (54%) - thanks to the introduction of AI.</p>
    <p>According to experts at Oxford University, by 2026 AI will write an essay that passes for human writing, replace truck drivers by 2027, and perform the work of a surgeon by 2053. Also, AI will surpass humans in all tasks within 45 years and automate all jobs within 120 years.</p>
    <p>The consulting company Accenture claims that AI can increase the profits of companies by an average of 38%. According to experts and business representatives, AI helps companies predict and identify problems, and also fills the gap in the skills of employees, although artificial intelligence is still far from building a business strategy.</p>
    <p>The majority of companies surveyed are investing in AI (90%) and agree that these technologies contribute to business development, found the MIT Sloan Management Review and BCG. However, companies have never learned how to really benefit from AI. And this is not the only problematic point in the field of artificial intelligen</p>
    <h3>The main challenges of AI technology</h3>
    <h3>Business Processes</h3>
    <p>In order for the company to make a profit, it is not enough to invest in the algorithm and get the first successful results after the launch of the pilot project. The introduction of AI is a multi-level process that includes cultural changes in the company, hiring and training data science specialists, automation and building business processes taking into account algorithms, and the whole list does not end there.</p>
    <p>"Speaking of implementations, it is necessary to make efforts in the proportions of 10-20-70. That is, approximately 10% of the effort should go to the creation of the algorithm, 20% to the construction of technology and 70% to the organization of business processes. The company must be at a certain level of technological maturity in order for the introduction of AI to be beneficial, "says Leonid Zhukov, CEO of the AIRI Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Senior Managing Director of the Sberbank Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>
    <p>Speaking at the international conference Sber AI Journey 2021, Jürgen Schmidhuber, an artificial intelligence scientist, chief scientific adviser of the AIRI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and scientific director of NNAISENSE, noted that companies are mainly focused on their particular problems, and not on the development of artificial intelligence technologies: most of their profits from AI come from  marketing and advertising sales.</p>
    <p>Giants such as <strong>Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google</strong> massively use deep artificial neural networks, for example, Long-Short-Term Memory, to predict the demand of users and keep them on their platforms longer, forcing them to click on more advertisements.</p>
    <h3>Lack of specialists</h3>
    <p>AI is developing at a high speed, and what was called state-of-the-art (the highest level of development) six months ago may be an average development today. If earlier a narrow layer of specialists was employed in the field of artificial intelligence, now with such a huge demand there is simply not enough qualified personnel capable of coping with the constantly developing technology, <u>Zhukov notes.</u></p>
    <p>Demand for AI specialists grew by 74% in 2016-2019, now two out of five companies using AI at an advanced level note an acute shortage of specialists, difficulties with hiring also top the list of problems in the field of AI.</p>
    <h3>Machine Learning Challenges</h3>
    <p><strong>Data quality</strong> is the second most important obstacle to  the introduction of AI, after the lack of specialists. For successful results, algorithms need high-quality "input", including marked and clean data. Incorrectly set patterns can provoke the system to draw false conclusions: for example, mistakenly signal a fraudulent transaction, or convict an innocent </p>
    <p>Quality is also affected by the degree of bias, or bias, including gender and racial prejudice to which a person working with an algorithm may be exposed.</p>
    <p><strong>The amount of data.</strong>In addition to quality, a computer still needs a lot of data and resources to perform the simplest tasks. AI will learn to distinguish dogs from cats  in three days, using 10 million images and 16,000 computers, while a child would have enough for a couple of photos and a few minutes. If the GPT-3 model was taught to read and write articles not on a supercomputer,  and on a conventional PC, the whole process would take about 500 years.</p>
    <p>"At the moment, AI researchers face several challenges. This is the ability of artificial intelligence to set new tasks based on existing knowledge; the ability to learn without forgetting the knowledge gained; and the ability to learn to break down a goal into sub-goals. Overcoming these problems will bring scientists closer to creating such machines that will be able to better understand a person and help achieve increasingly ambitious goals, "says Mikhail Burtsev, director of fundamental research at the AIRI Institute of Artificial Intelligence, head of the Laboratory of Neural Systems and Deep Learning at MIPT.</p>
    <p><strong>Apply in a different context. </strong> Although artificial intelligence today is able to perform various functions - from recognizing cats and dogs to predicting breakdowns on oil platforms - these are still narrowly focused tasks. AI does not yet know how to apply the acquired skills in unusual conditions.</p>
    <h3>Influence of climate</h3>
    <p>The problem of energy consumption by artificial intelligence is directly related to the number of resources involved in data processing. Training a single NLP model (similar to GPT) requires as much energy as a car in its lifetime and produces five times more CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p><u>Globally, data centers consume about 200 TWh of electricity a year — more than some countries. At the same time, there's the opposite effect — AI will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 to 4 percent by 2030, according to a report by the European Parliament.</u></p>
    <h3>The use of AI in science</h3>
    <p>Machine learning has become a key tool for researchers from different fields, but the potential of AI in science has yet to be unlocked, notes Leonid Zhukov. Stimulating new discoveries with THE HELP of AI is relevant, for example, in the field of creating new materials using calculations or in forecasting climate change to develop strategies to increase resistance to environmental change. For example, as part of the quest to achieve carbon neutrality, scientists from the AIRI Institute's New Materials Research Group, together with Sberbank, have developed prototype models that optimize quality control in the production of solar cells.</p>
    <p>In the future, machine learning can be more actively used to protect wildlife in inaccessible regions and count individuals, understand complex organic chemistry and in the study of dark matter.</p>
